    Attaching tokens to a NOTE will let you toggle vision on/off via that Note's vision button.
    </br>
    Also added Blind.

    You can thank Andrew.

    <h1>Smoke & Spectre! 9/20</h1>
    Added a toggle for the grid snapping, for those who don't want it.
    </br>
    Also added snapping to the polygon tool, because I apparently forgot.
    </br>
    </br>
    <h1>Smoke & Spectre! 9/16</h1>
    Fixed a bug where the boundary input was going crazy if you changed the scale of the box.
    </br>
    Possibly fixed a bug to do with enabling vision lines for DFog1.0 lines.
    </br>
    Updated the messaging on the Spectre control to show 'No players' if there is no one in game to set vision to.
    </br>
    Also updated the control to refresh on player changes.
