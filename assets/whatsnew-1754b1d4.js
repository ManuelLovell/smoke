  <sub>Token Ownership </sub>
  </br>
  <li>If you are logged in and pull a token from your own dock, you are automatically the owner of that token.
  </br>
  <li>You can also have a GM assign you as owner, if they use the Player action button, go to Player Permissions and turn on "Owner Only".
  </br>
  After this, they can assign owners on a token's ContextMenu anytime.
  </br>
  <li>If your GM is using Clash! they can also assign ownership by right-clicking a unit in the Initiative List.
  </br>
  </br>
  <sub>Token Vision</sub>
  </br>
  <li>If you see 'Vision Disabled' on a token in your list, it means the GM has not enabled vision for that token.
  </br>
  <li>GM-Owned tokens with vision share their vision with all players..

    <li>Clicking the "Enable Dynamic Fog" button OFF now REMOVES THE FOG FILL. BE AWARE.
    <li>Added more clarity on the player-end. Their window now shows a list of all tokens they own in the scene and if it has vision enabled.
    <li>Also added a help button on Player end, to explain how vision works and what THEY can do to fix that. (Generally it means they don't own a token)

    See you around~ Battle-System (Que!)

    <h1>Smoke & Spectre! 15/11/2023</h1>
    </br>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the fog color selector hitting the rate limit.
    <li>Added some resilience to Spectre - it'll now backup your Spectre'd objects to the scene. So you can refresh and keep your spectres.
    <li>They will lose their targets though (and on the player end, if you refresh, they disappear for that duration anyway). But you can set them again.
    <li>Also you should be able to 'Un-Spectre' now.
    </br>
    See you around~ Battle-System (Que!)

    Attaching tokens to a NOTE will let you toggle vision on/off via that Note's vision button.
    </br>
    Also added Blind.
    </br>
    You can thank Andrew.

    <h1>Smoke & Spectre! 9/20</h1>
    Added a toggle for the grid snapping, for those who don't want it.
    </br>
    Also added snapping to the polygon tool, because I apparently forgot.
    </br>
    </br>
    <h1>Smoke & Spectre! 9/16</h1>
    Fixed a bug where the boundary input was going crazy if you changed the scale of the box.
    </br>
    Possibly fixed a bug to do with enabling vision lines for DFog1.0 lines.
    </br>
    Updated the messaging on the Spectre control to show 'No players' if there is no one in game to set vision to.
    </br>
    Also updated the control to refresh on player changes.
